# Hello Astro!

This is my first blog post built with Astro. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

## What is Astro?

Astro is a modern static site builder that allows you to use your favorite JavaScript framework components while delivering lightning-fast performance.

## Why I love Astro

- **Performance**: Astro ships zero JavaScript by default
- **Framework Agnostic**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or any other framework
- **Easy to Learn**: If you know HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, you can build with Astro
