# Getting Started with Astro

In this post, I'll walk you through the basics of setting up an Astro project and creating your first pages.

## Installation

To create a new Astro project, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

## Project Structure

A typical Astro project has the following structure:

- `src/pages/` - Your page routes
- `src/layouts/` - Reusable page layouts
- `src/components/` - UI components
- `public/` - Static assets

## Creating Your First Page

All `.astro` files in the `src/pages/` directory automatically become pages on your site.
